Updated DeepPoly System
========

The project builds on top of ETH Robustness Analyzer for Neural Networks (ERAN), which is a state-of-the-art sound, precise, and scalable analyzer based on [abstract interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation) for the complete and incomplete verification of MNIST, CIFAR10, and ACAS Xu based networks. ERAN produces state-of-the-art precision and performance for both complete and incomplete verification. ERAN is developed at the [SRI Lab, Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/) as part of the [Safe AI project](http://safeai.ethz.ch/). The goal of ERAN is to automatically verify safety properties of neural networks with feedforward, convolutional, and residual layers against input perturbations (e.g.,  Lâˆž-norm attacks, geometric transformations, etc).
